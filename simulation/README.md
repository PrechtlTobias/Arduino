# Tinkercad

Tinkercad Circuits is an easy way to get started with learning electronics. 
Using the interactive circuit editor, we can explore, connect, and code virtual projects with a bottomless toolbox of simulated components.

After signing in to Tinkercad we will find a dashboard of our recent designs. 
By default, this dashboard will showcase designs made with Tinkercadâ€™s 3D editor. 
To see a view of our Circuit designs, simply click the **Circuits** link in the left menu.

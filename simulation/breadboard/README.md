# Breadboard

A breadboard is used to to hold the electronic components.
In a real breadboard, we can simply plug the components in and pull them out without the help of tools.

It is important to know **how the pins on the breadboard are wired** in order to get the desired connection between the components.

* The **outermost tracks** (or busses) which are marked with `+` and `-` are connected horizontally - indicated by the black and red wires.

* The **inner tracks** (or rows) are each connected vertically - shown by the green wires.

* If you point to a lane with the mouse, the connection is briefly displayed.

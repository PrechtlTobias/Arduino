# LEDs and Switch

The following example shows the usage of LEDs and a switch.

![LEDs and Switch](led-and-switch.png)


* The power supply is used to provide a 5V operating voltage.
  At the same time the current is measured.

* Every **LED** has its own **resistor** (470 Ohm) to reduce the current.

* Every **switch** has a 10 KOhm **pull-doen resistor** which pulls the potential to GND.
  When we flip the switch, the potential is changed to 5V.

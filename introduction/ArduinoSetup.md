# Setup Arduino IDE

The easiest way to program the Arduino board is with the **Arduino IDE**. 

This is a very simple development environment that comes with all the tools needed 
to write the source code, compile it and load it onto the Arduino board.

* Download the Arduino IDE: Go to [download](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and
    save the current version of the ZIP file, e.g. `arduino-1.8.19-windows.zip`

* Unzip the `arduino-1.8.19-windows.zip` file in a local folder.

* Open the `arduino-1.8.19` folder and execute `arduino.exe` - that's it!
